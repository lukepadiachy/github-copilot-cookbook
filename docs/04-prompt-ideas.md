# Prompting

**Ask better, get better.** This section explores effective strategies for crafting prompts that get the most out of GitHub Copilot, helping you communicate your intent clearly and receive more accurate suggestions.

## Why Good Prompts Matter

The way you communicate with GitHub Copilot dramatically affects the quality of code it generates. Learning to craft effective prompts will:

- **Save time** by getting useful code on the first try
- **Reduce errors** in generated code
- **Unlock advanced functionality** you might not know exists
- **Help Copilot understand context** better

## Prompt Techniques

### Comment-Driven Development
Use detailed comments to guide Copilot's suggestions:

- **Function descriptions**: Write a comment describing what a function should do before implementing it
- **Step-by-step planning**: Outline logic in comments before generating code
- **Edge case mentions**: Note edge cases you want handled in comments

### Natural Language Strategies
When chatting with Copilot:

- **Be specific**: Include language, framework, and version information
