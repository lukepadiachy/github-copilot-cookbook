# âœ… Best Practices

**Work smarter, not harder.** This section covers proven strategies and techniques to maximize your productivity with GitHub Copilot while maintaining code quality and security standards.

## Why Best Practices Matter

Using GitHub Copilot effectively requires more than just accepting suggestions. Following best practices helps you:

- **Get more relevant code** tailored to your specific needs
- **Maintain security** in your codebase
- **Avoid common pitfalls** when working with AI-generated code
- **Integrate Copilot** seamlessly into your development workflow

## Key Strategies

### Quality Control

- **Always review generated code** for logical errors and security issues
- **Run tests** on AI-generated code, especially for critical components
- **Understand the code** before accepting it (don't blindly trust suggestions)

### Workflow Integration

- **Start with comments** to guide Copilot's suggestions
- **Be specific** about languages, frameworks, and patterns you want
- **Iterate on suggestions** rather than expecting perfect code immediately

### Security Considerations

- **Never send sensitive information** in prompts
- **Review code for vulnerabilities** before committing
- **Use appropriate privacy settings** for your organization's needs
